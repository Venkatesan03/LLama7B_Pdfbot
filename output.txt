Amazon Rainfor est, large tropical rainforest
occupying the drainage basin  of the Amazon River
and its tributaries in northern South America  and
covering an area of 2,300,000 square miles (6,000,000
square km). Comprising about 40 percent of Brazil ’s
total area, it is bounded by the Guiana Highlands  to
the north, the Andes Mountains  to the west, the
Brazilian central plateau  to the south, and the Atlantic
Ocean  to the east.
A brief treatment of the Amazon Rainforest follows. For full treatment, see South America:
Amazon River basin .
Amazonia is the lar gest river basin in the world, and
its forest  stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east
to the tree line of the Andes in the west. The forest
widens from a 200-mile (320-km) front along the
Atlantic to a belt 1,200 miles (1,900 km) wide where
the lowlands meet the Andean foothills. The immense
extent and great continuity of this rainforest  is a
reﬂection of the high rainfall , high humidity , and
monotonously high temperatures  that prevail in the region.
The Amazon Rainforest is the world’ s richest and most-varied biological reservoir ,
containing several million species  of insects , plants , birds , and other forms of life, many
still unrecorded by science . The luxuriant vegetation encompasses a wide variety of trees ,
including many species of myrtle , laurel , palm , and acacia , as well as rosewood , Brazil nut ,
and rubber  tree. Excellent timber is furnished by the mahogany  and the Amazonian cedar .
Major wildlife includes jaguar , manatee , tapir, red deer , capybara  and many other types of
rodents , and several types of monkeys .
In the 20th century , Brazil’ s rapidly growing population settled major areas of the Amazon
Rainforest. The size of the Amazon forest shrank dramatically as a result of settlers’
clearance of the land to obtain lumber and to create grazing pastures and farmland. Brazil
holds approximately 60 percent of the Amazon basin within its borders, and some12/09/2023, 23:03 Amazon Rainforest -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia

1,583,000 square miles (4,100,000 square km) of this was covered by forests in 1970. The
amount of forest cover declined to some 1,283,000 square miles (3,323,000 square km) by
2016, about 81 percent of the area that had been covered by forests in 1970. In the 1990s
the Brazilian government and various international bodies began ef forts to protect parts of
the forest from human encroachment, exploitation, deforestation , and other forms of
destruction. Although Brazil’ s Amazon continues to lose forest cover , the pace of this loss
declined from roughly 0.4 percent per year during the 1980s and ’90s to roughly 0.1–0.2
percent per year between 2008 and 2016. However , some 75,000 ﬁres occurred in the
Brazilian Amazon during the ﬁrst half of 2019 (an increase of 85 percent over 2018),
largely due to encouragement from Brazilian Pres. Jair Bolsonaro , a strong proponent of
tree clearing.
In 2007 Ecuador  initiated a unique plan to preserve a portion of the forest within its
borders, which lies in Yasuní National Park (established 1979), one of the world’ s most
biodiverse  regions: the Ecuadoran government agreed to for go development of heavy oil
deposits (worth an estimated $7.2 billion) beneath the Yasuní rainforest if other countries
and private donors contributed half of the deposits’  value to a UN-administered trust fund
for Ecuador . In 2013, however , Ecuador abandoned the plan, after only $6.5 million had
been raised by the end of 2012. By 2016 the state oil company Petroecuador had begun to
drill and extract petroleum from the park.
